The Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project (UPPER) started its operation since July 06 2021. It can produce a total of 456MW electricity with 6 turbines at the capacity of 76MW each.  It is one of a national pride project, the largest project ever carried out within Nepal, without any international financial assistance.

The project started in 2011 and took 10 years to complete and saw massive costs and time overruns. The initial expected cost of the project was estimated to be NPR 35 billion and was expected to be completed in 5 years by July 2016. However, it took 5 more years and completed in July 2021 and the cost soared to NPR 85 billion, more than double of what was estimated.

The majority share (51 percent) of the project is held by four public entities, namely, Nepal Electricity Authority, Nepal Telecom, Citizen Investment Trust and Rastriya Beema Sansthan.
