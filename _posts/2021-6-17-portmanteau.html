            A portmanteau is the fusion of two words coming together to create a new word. It was first used by Lewis Carroll in 1871, based on the concept of two words packed together, like a portmanteau (“a travelling case having two halves joined by a hinge”). Writers use portmanteaus to make their word choice more interesting.

            <div class="note">
                One thing that many people get Portmanteaus confused with is compound words. Portmanteau are different from compound words.

                    A compound word is a combination of two or more words that function as a single unit of meaning and the spelling of the two words doesn't change.

                For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sun + Flower = Sunflower</li>
                    <li>Star + Fish = Starfish</li>
                    <li>Snow + Man = Snowman</li>
                    <li>Snow + Man = Snowman</span>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
